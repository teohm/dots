# dots

This is my personal dotfiles.

I'm using a [simple git-based workflow](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) to manage these files. It works surprisingly well for me.

## Install

```
curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/teohm/dots/master/bin/dots-install | bash
```

## Setup

```
bin/setup
```

## Want to use it?

DO NOT install this directly on your machine, because I hardcoded my personal URLs in setup and install scripts.

Fork and modify `bin/dots-install` and `bin/setup`.

This work is under public domain, so feel free to use it :)
